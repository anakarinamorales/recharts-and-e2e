# Introduction

You've been invited to complete this coding assignment. We deliberately keep the assignment vague, leaving much room for you to make choices. Please document your design choices. Feel free to implement this in your own preferred tech stack. We do not expect you to spend days on this nor to build a full-blown application.

Good luck!

# Assignment

In this repository you'll find a server application which exposes two endpoints. One to fetch meter interval data, and another to submit a new entry.

We would like to ask you to build a frontend that:
* Visualises the meter interval data fetched from the server. We fully leave it up to you on how to design something for this.
* Has a way for a user to upload more meter interval data which is then also visualized.

## Running the server

```
cd server/
npm install
node app.js
```

It will expose a server app running on port: 3001.
Please inspect the sources to figure out how the endpoints work. Feel free to also adapt the server if you see fit.
